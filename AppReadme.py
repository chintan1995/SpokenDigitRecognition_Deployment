This webapp will recognize what digit you spoke, using Deep Learning.
## How to use it?

Using "Default audio" option:
- I have uploaded some spoken digits' audio by default.
- Upon selecting the appropriate radio button, the audio will be fetched and recognized.
- You will be able to see the recognized number.
 
Using "Upload your audio" option:
- You can upload your audio using Drag and Drop or using Browse file button.
- Once the audio is uploaded, click on "Recognize this audio" button.
- You will be able to see the recognized number.

# Things to keep in mind:

  - This model recognizes only single digit numbers. So, whatever audio you upload must have only single number.
  - Only .wav files are supported as of now.
